<p>This test utilizes the <a href='https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/NavigationTiming/Overview.html'>Navigation Timing API</a> to give you a ballpark estimate of how long a certain asset or common site configuration takes to load.</p>
<p>The result is arrived at by calculating <code>performance.loadEventEnd - performance.requestStart</code>. This determines the time (in ms) from the browser starts requesting resources from the server (after DNS has been resolved) to the moment the load event finishes.</p>
<p> Each test is run twelve times. On completion, the lowest and highest values are removed, and the arithmetic mean of the remaining values gets displayed.
